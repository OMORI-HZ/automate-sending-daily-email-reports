Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You'll need the smtplib and email libraries, which are part of Python's standard library, and optionally schedule for scheduling tasks. If you don't have schedule, you can install it using pip:
```pip install schedule```
Step 2: Configure Email Server Settings
Replace the placeholder values with your actual SMTP server details and login credentials:

SMTP_SERVER: The SMTP server address (e.g., 'smtp.gmail.com' for Gmail).
SMTP_PORT: The SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS).
SMTP_USER: Your email address.
SMTP_PASSWORD: Your email password.
Step 3: Schedule the Script
The script uses the schedule library to run the send_email function every day at the specified time. You can customize the time by modifying the schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(send_email) line.

Step 4: Running the Script
Save the script as daily_email_report.py and run it using Python:

```python daily_email_report.py```
To ensure the script runs continuously and sends the email daily, you can use a task scheduler like cron on Unix-based systems or the Task Scheduler on Windows.

Setting Up Cron (Unix-based Systems)
Open your crontab file:
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add a new cron job to run the script daily at a specific time:
```0 8 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/daily_email_report.py```
This example runs the script every day at 8:00 AM.
Setting Up Task Scheduler (Windows)
Open Task Scheduler.
Create a new task.
Set the trigger to daily and specify the time.
Set the action to start a program and browse to your Python executable and script.
By following these steps, you can automate sending daily email reports using Python. If you need to include attachments or more complex email content, you can expand the send_email function accordingly.
